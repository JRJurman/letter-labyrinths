# letter-labyrinths

This repo contains a bunch of assets and logic for building the Letter Labyrinths board game. This was used in conjunction with excalidraw and component studio, so while it should be possible to rebuild most of the game, your milage may vary.

There is a general folder of assets, code for building card configurations, and other resources.
