# letter-labyrinths

This repo contains a bunch of assets and logic for building the Letter Labyrinths board game. This was used in conjunction with excalidraw and component studio, so while it should be possible to rebuild most of the game, your milage may vary.

## Development instructions

1. In the root directory, run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the dev server
3. Navigate to http://localhost:1234 (or the url provided after running `npm start`)

## Development commands

Below are a list of commands used for development. The logic for all the commands is in the local `package.json`

- `npm start` - starts a server hosting the webapp on localhost using
  [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  and will watch for changes
- `npm run build` - builds a final distributable using
  [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- `npm test` - runs tests in
  [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
